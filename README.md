# Film-Connoisseur-Website

This was our first project combining everything we learned from phase one of the bootcamp to make a simple front end web page with functionality using server side apis, frameworks, and local storage. This project was tough and sometimes we would be stuck writing a certain piece of code, but in the end we achieved much of what we set out for. 

## User Story

```
As a film connoisseur
I WANT to know more information about a movie
SO THAT I know if I want to watch it (based on reviews, cast description, poster, etc).

```
